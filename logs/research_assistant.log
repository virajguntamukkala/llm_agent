**Title:** Random Polyhedral Scenes: An Image Generator for Active Vision System Experiments  
**Authors:** Markus D. Solbach, Stephen Voland, Jeff Edmonds, John K. Tsotsos  
**Abstract:** We present a Polyhedral Scene Generator system which creates a random scene based on a few user parameters, renders the scene from random viewpoints, and creates a dataset containing the renderings and corresponding annotation files. The generator enables research on how a program could parse a scene with multiple viewpoints, particularly in the field of active perception. The system is designed to support research in active perception by generating images of scenes with known complexity characteristics. The paper is available at [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10100v1).

Here is the BibTeX entry for the paper:

Abstract      = {We present a Polyhedral Scene Generator system which creates a random scene
based on a few user parameters, renders the scene from random view points and
creates a dataset containing the renderings and corresponding annotation files.
We hope that this generator will enable research on how a program could parse a
scene if it had multiple viewpoints to consider. For ambiguous scenes,
typically people move their head or change their position to see the scene from
different angles as well as seeing how it changes while they move; this
research field is called active perception. The random scene generator
presented is designed to support research in this field by generating images of
scenes with known complexity characteristics and with verifiable properties
with respect to the distribution of features across a population. Thus, it is
well-suited for research in active perception without the requirement of a live
3D environment and mobile sensing agent, including comparative performance
evaluations. The system is publicly available at
