## Research Agent and Tools

The heart of the application lies in the Research Agent, an AI-powered (OpenAI) system designed to assist users with their research inquiries. The agent, build using LangChain, leverages the capabilities of the following tools:

- **Arxiv Retrival**: Users can query for Arxiv research papers based on paper name, topic, authors, etc. 

- **BibTex Generation**:  Users can ask for the BibTex of the queried papers.

The Research Agent processes user input, generates responses, and maintains a chat history to provide a seamless conversational experience.
